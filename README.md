# Core Gameplay Prototype Requirements #
- Audio: Continuously looping background sound (title screen music) and gong sound when player clicks to begin
- Visual: Image-based assets as seen in the Core Gameplay scene, and shader-based visual effect (to be implemented)
- My goal was to have the title screen appear like the following: https://labs.phaser.io/edit.html?src=src/game%20objects/shaders/change%20shader%20texture.js
- Motion: Tweens-powered motion as seen with the text in the Core Gameplay Scene
- Progression: Will most likely progress through gaining items/ character or narrative progression. Will link to scene flow/cinematics
- Prefabs: Adventure.js engine along with new member functions, AdventureScenes to be added as well as Phaser.Scene classes
